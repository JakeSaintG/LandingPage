## Pokédex App Project Synopsis
I’m going to make the same app 6 times! In order to gain familiarity with each of big app development platforms, I will be creating the same basic application for each of them. That's Flutter, Kotlin, Swift, MAUI, and React Native in addition to the POC project made in React. Since I’m very familiar with Pokémon and PokéAPI, that’s what I will be using as a foundation for this project.

## Why? 
Well, I want to learn mobile app development. The goal of this isn't to become an expert in ALL of the app development platforms but to become familiar enough to get started making projects in any of them if needed.

## Basic Requirements
- An application that persists data
- An application that can communicate with an outside API when there is an internet connection.
- An application that can work offline if needed

## Details
I’m going to start by doing what I know which, in this case, is writing a frontend web application. This will help me think through my logic, functionality, and blockers before I enter less-charted territory. I mulled over the idea of coupling it to a C# “backend” mostly just to stick with my familiarity with writing to SQLite with this N-Tier approach. After talking it over with some of my big-brained friends, I decided to a 100% React application for this POC. 

After the POC is done, I’m going to move on to my first mobile app development experience with React Native. Why React Native? Well…I will already have a bunch of React code. I’m hoping the lift-and-shift won’t be too crazy. (Future Jake, check me on that assumption)

Next will be a total re-write in the framework that I am most interested in: Flutter. Following Flutter will be an attempt at doing the Pokédex app in Kotlin and Swift. Finally, we’ll pushing my attention span to the limit and I’ll be attempting to do it again in .NET MAUI.
