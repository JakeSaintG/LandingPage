## Process
I’m going to make the same app 6 times! Each in a different language/framework. Sounds crazy, right? I’m very familiar with Pokémon and PokéAPI so that’s what I will be using as a foundation for this project. I will be making a PokéDex app for each of these apps. 

## Why? 
I want to learn mobile app development

## Requirements
I knew I wanted an application that persisted data, can work offline, and can communicate with an outside API.

## Details
I’m going to start by doing what I know which is writing a frontend web application. This will help me think through my logic, functionality, and blockers before I enter less-charted territory. I mulled over the idea of coupling it to a C# “backend” mostly just to stick with my familiarity with writing to SQLite with this N-Tier approach. After talking it over with some of my big-brained friends, I decided to a 100% React application for this POC. 

After the POC is done, I’m going to move on to my first mobile app development experience with React Native. Why React Native? Well…I will already have a bunch of React code. I’m hoping the lift-and-shift won’t be too crazy.

Next will be a total re-write in the framework that I am most interested in: Flutter. Following Flutter will be an attempt at doing the Pokédex app in Kotlin and Swift. Finally, and we’ll see how long my attention span holds, I’ll be attempting to do it again in .NET MAUI.
