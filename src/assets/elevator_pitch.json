        "Hello! I'm Jake St. Germain. A software developer, registered nurse, 3D modeler, and long-time learner. I've worked on a great deal of projects as a dev and my experience as Pediatic ICU Nurse has helped me to remain calm, cool, as well as collected under pressure. While not 100% sure what I want to be when I grow up, I know it will involve code and technology. I live to learn new things and I hope that you reach out to chat!",
